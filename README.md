## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

This is my third challenge of the platform, which personally more than learning, was a practice after having spent several months studying the Backend with little interaction with the Frontend, so it cost me a little remember some CSS sentences, however, I think I reached a good result despite the lack of practice already mentioned.
